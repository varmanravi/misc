SRE tools Development

Develop SRE central and deliver the minimum viable product. MVP-1 - Design Develop and deploy the portal to digitalize the maturity model to capture the SRE journey of the products across TI.

SRE transformation

Enable one product team on SRE transformation journey by taking up the maturity assesment to baseline and improve the SRE outcomes. Measurement - Pick up one or few of the SRE outcomes and improve the baseline from foundation to disciplined and mature. For ex: Ownership on establishing the SLI's baseline and target SLO's, standardize the telemetry strategy and progress towards 99.99% availability.
